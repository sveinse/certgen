# Optionally include a file that is generated by the OpenSSL fipsinstall
# application. This file contains configuration data required by the OpenSSL

# If you add a section explicitly activating any other provider(s), you most
# probably need to explicitly activate the default provider, otherwise it

# OpenSSL may not work correctly which could lead to significant system
# problems including inability to remotely access the system.
